# Machine Learning-CodingChallenge

I am conducting a coding challenge session , objective here is to solve problems using Machine Learning from Scratch(just using numpy). 


## Session 1 : Linear Regression
 
**About** : In this part of this exercise, you will implement linear regression with gradient desent to predict the brain weight based on Gender, Age and head size.

## Session 2 - Logistic Regression

**About** : In this exercise, we will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets. One in which data is linear and other in which data is non linear. Here we also see regularization and apply polynomial features to handle non linear dataset

## Session 3 - Logistic Regression For Multi-Class Classification

**About** : In this execise, we will implement logistic regression for Multi-class classification influenced by concept provided by ndrew ng on one-vs-all. Here we will recognize handwritten digits(from 0 - 9). Here we  will extend our previous implemen-
tion of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification.

## Session 4 - Neural Networks From Scratch

**About** : Objective here is to simple neural network using numpy to predict with simple Toy Dataset and create a object model like CNTK, Pytorch so that neural network can created with ease.

## Session 5 - Neural Networks From Scratch To Recognize Handwritten Number

**About** : It is an extention to the neural network which we built in last session and this includes creation of multiple activation/loss functions, regularization and create a model to predict handwritten digits(0-9)

## Session 6 - With DropOut - Neural Networks From Scratch 

**About** : In this session, we will discuss dropout in detail and compare it with ensemble or bagging techniques. Extend our neural network which we builded before to support Dropout.
